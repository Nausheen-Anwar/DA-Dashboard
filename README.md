## Data sources

Available source options include:

- **Upload files:** CSV, TSV, TXT, Excel, JSON, and Parquet.
- **Excel sheet selection:** choose a worksheet when loading an Excel workbook.
- **Multiple files:** upload more than one file and combine/stack them into one table where supported.
- **Local folder:** enter a folder path, then choose a file listed from that folder.
- **Online URL:** load a CSV, Excel, or JSON file from a URL.
- **Database:** connect to SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server through ODBC. Choose a table or provide your own `SELECT` query.

Database access depends on the database service, connection settings, and required drivers being available.

## Data selection and initial state

Titles, data sources, columns, ranges, and chart options start empty. Nothing is pre-filled or pre-selected. Select the required data and options before running an analysis.

## Visualization

- Set the chart options and **Graph title**.
- Download the chart in PNG, PDF, or SVG format when the corresponding option is available.

## Statistical analysis

- **Statistical parameters:** calculate descriptive statistical values for the selected data.
- **Correlation:** display a Pearson correlation matrix for suitable numeric columns.
- **Hypothesis testing:** supports the implemented one-sample t-test, independent two-sample t-test, paired t-test, and Pearson correlation significance test.
- **Probability density:** choose a sample from a column or a single row, then display a KDE, a normal PDF, or both. Available downloads include PNG, PDF, SVG, and CSV.

Some analysis require numeric columns or enough valid observations. Results depend on the data and options selected.

## PDF report

Use **Save whole page / report** to download a PDF containing the current selected-data preview and analysis sections available in the current session.

## Feedback

The final Feedback section accepts a rating from **1 to 5** and optional comments.
